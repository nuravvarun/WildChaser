# WildChaser
Wild chaser is an android based 2d racing game which is built on unity game engine with the unity c# scripting and a bit of adobe Photoshop and illustrator graphics. We have tried our best to give the exact object behavior that a user will expect like basic movement functionalities and sprite animations. Finally we came up with a very flexible system that can set and scale sprite sheets resulting in a fully animated sprite animation.
At first we started with the process of creating sprites for our game’s vehicle by sketching out its design where we have used a layered process to create multiple iterations of the animation sprites after that we have followed the same for track tiles and other game assets.
Then comes the core game play functionality part, here we started with the boundaries for the level so that the player the player can’t leave the game area then we have assembled it all.
After that we have worked a little on the game AI by implementing bots (enemy) and powerups.
Then we finished up by creating menu by implementing a startup menu and at last come the memory management which is done by consolidating scripts that result in reduced memory usage.
